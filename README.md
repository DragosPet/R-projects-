# R-projects-

# In this repository you cand find several school and personal projects. I used a couple of data analysis tehniques and some Machine Learning algorithms in order to understand how data from various sources and related to different areas can improve decision making.

# In FIFA_players_analysis.R I have applied exploratory and explanatory analysis on data from FIFA 2018. The dataset is downloaded from kaggle datasets and it contains some of the best footbalers of the game and their attributes. I have tried to understand the attributes that are used to give a player a certain rank amongst the FIFA Universe. I've used Principal comonent analysis, cluster analysis, Bayesian analysis and I have constructed even a Neural Network but given the fact that the dataset I used was pretty small, it did not produce great results.  

# In markov_test.R I have tried to implement a new perspective regarding voting behavior prediction using a Markov Process aproach (voting described as a memoryless process) . I used the markovchain library, available in R and used some results from voting polls regarding parties and shares in the Romanian electoral campaign. I used then a simulated matrix containing pivot probabilities and predicted shares obtained in the next campaign.
